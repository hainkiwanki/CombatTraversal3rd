# CombatTraversal3rd

This project is a course taken on udemy which can be found here:
https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-3rd-person-combat-traversal/learn/lecture/31900790?start=75#overview

The goal of this project is to see how far my knowledge spreads. I am following this course in the hope to bump into something I haven't seen before or to see if I missed any good-practice coding rules.
